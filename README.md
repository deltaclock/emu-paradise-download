## Installation

### Linux and MacOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deltaclock/emu-paradise-download.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or even better using a venv

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows

There is a high chance the windows binary is outdated.
Take a look at releases, for the latest build.

(In the future maybe use travis to build a win exe on every change)

## Usage

Run the script on a terminal and follow the on screen menu.

### Linux & MacOS

`python3 emuDl.py`

### Windows

Windows users should open cmd or powershell and run the exe found in the releases page.

`.\emuDl.exe`
